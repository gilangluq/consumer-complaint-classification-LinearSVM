For example, the categories Credit card and Prepaid card are also covered by the broader Credit card or prepaid card category. Now, if a new complaint is related to a credit card, the algorithm could classify it as either Credit card or Credit card or prepaid card, both of which would be correct. However, this could negatively impact the model's performance. To prevent this issue, certain category names should be revised."
